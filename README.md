# Speaker Recognition API

This is a simple demo of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speaker Recognition APIs:

1. Speaker Verification
1. Speaker Identification

By using your browser's built-in audio recording capabilities, and a custom version of the fantastic RecorderJS to convert the raw audio into the format required by Cognitive Services, you can easily have a play around with using your voice as a form of verification and also to identify who is talking out of a group of people.

Super cool stuff.
